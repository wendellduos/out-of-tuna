## Proposed engine functionality:

### Player Movement

A side scroller game with obstacles, similar to [T-Rex Chrome Dino Game](https://chromedino.com). Player movement isn't automatic but is limited to `up`, `down`, and `allow move right`, in which the player will gain speed exponentially until it reaches maximum speed.

### Health

Player loses health when colliding with enemies, but health can be restored with health pick-ups scattered around the map.

If player collides with a wall, all health is decreased and the game ends.
### Obstacles

The player will encounter various types of enemies. Each with slightly different behavior to increase dificulty.

Each hit (or collision) with an obstacle makes the player's singing a bit out of tune, decreasing singing in semi-tones for a small period.
### Map Displacement

Maps have to be randomly generated as player progresses through the stage, with more speed added, and different obstacles/enemies get introduced along with it.

Map moves to the left, but not up and down. Vertical movement is done by the player's sprite. 

Background and foreground movement speeds are slightly offset to create an effect of paralax.

## Scoreboard

By the end of each game, the user will be able to save its score in the scoreboard.

The scoreboard has to be pre-populated with at least ten high-scores.
