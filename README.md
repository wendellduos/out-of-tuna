# Out of Tuna

Out of Tuna - A search for the last fish, is the tale of Freddy, a brave little cat that is willing to go 'til the end to find the last tuna fish, as told by the legends of old.

The path may be dangerous, but Freddy has been waiting for this moment ever since he was just a little kitty, telling his mommy "Meooow, mrrp mrrrrp rrrmeowwww".
